# ATM_Casestudy
In this,I have implemented 3 common constraints and all my individual constraints.
I have an adminclass and classes for transactions done by user.
User can have a mini statement,and balance,withdrawal,deposit
Admin have access to setcashlimit in atm and maxtransaction done by user and also to view the transactions done by users.
